### Gender Identity, Peer Effects, and Research Focus: Evidence from PhD Dissertations (with [Hongyuan Xia](https://economics.cornell.edu/hongyuan-xia)) (Under Major Extension) Aug 2022

Abstract: Using a universe record of PhD dissertations in the US, we find a substantial amount of missing female PhD and female-focus research from 1985 to 2015. Our decomposition exercise quantifies the driving forces of this phenomenon. Besides, we find a close connection between PhD gender identity and their research focus: females are more likely to do female-focus research (FFR), while males are less likely. We further causally identify the peer effects of producing female-focus research: a higher female ratio in the PhD cohort encourages females but discourages male PhDs doing FFR, which is in favor of a competition effect in addition to knowledge diffusion in FFR production. These effects last for at least 5 years after graduation. Further investigation indicates the homophily and coauthor network explain the differential effects on female and male PhDs.

### [Childlessness and Development](https://paulwdai.github.io/files/childlessness.pdf) (Preliminary Draft) Feb 2023

Abstract: This paper leverages harmonized micro-data consisting of 82 million females from 164 household surveys covering 78 unique countries from all income level to exhibit novel findings between childlessness (the extensive margin of fertility) and development. Childlessness rate displays a U-shaped relationship with development, and contributes to 1/3 of heterogeneity of aggregate fertility worldwide. Investigating how females are selected into childlessness across countries, I argue heterogeneous life-cycle childlessness rates in different countries is the key driving forces behind this childlessness rates differentials. Specifically, females in richer countries delay their fertility. I construct a two-period model, highlighting the motives for fertility delay (wage growth motive and dynamic motive) as well as reasons for childlessness (natural sterilization and preference-driven motive). The model points out key components to explain these empirical evidences jointly: the life-cycle wage growth profile and the joint distribution of wage and preference for having kids.

### [Life-Cycle Remittance for Rural-Urban Migrants](https://paulwdai.github.io/files/remittance.pdf) Nov 2020

Abstract: Using China Household Income Survey data, I document an inverse U-shaped income and a declining remittance profile over life cycle for rural-to-urban migrants to their family members left in the rural sector. I formulate and calibrate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with agents heterogeneous in demographical characteristics making migration and remittance decision, which is motivated by the altruism to family members. I identify a huge migration cost associated with land, a fixed benefit of living in the urban and an exogenous exit rate out of urban. My decomposition exercise indicates that evolution of household characteristics is determinant for declining remittance over ages. Policy related counterfactual analysis suggests abolishing land associated cost and exogenous exit from urban result in migration rates of  12.87% and 83.31% respectively compared with current rate of 27.51%.
