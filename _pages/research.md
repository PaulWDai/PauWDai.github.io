[Childlessness and Development](https://paulwdai.github.io/files/childlessness.pdf) (Preliminary Draft) May 2022

Abstract: This paper leverages harmonized micro-data consisting of 82 million females from 164 household surveys covering 72 unique countries from all income levels to investigate the relationship between childlessness and development. Empirically, I find that childlessness rates display a U-shaped pattern with development at country, subgroups and individual levels, which contribute to 1/3 of heterogeneity of aggregate fertility across countries. Moreover, females in richer countries and those are more educated delay their fertility, suggested by the life-cycle childlessness rates. Combining these novel empirical findings, I construct a two-period model under a parsimonious set of assumptions to speak to the empirical finding: when the wage growth effect dominates the wage level effect, females choose to delay fertility; childlessness is driven by natural sterilization and different preference for number of children.

[Life-Cycle Remittance for Rural-Urban Migrants](https://paulwdai.github.io/files/remittance.pdf) Nov 2020

Abstract: Using China Household Income Survey data, I document an inverse U-shaped income and a declining remittance profile over life cycle for rural-to-urban migrants to their family members left in the rural sector. I formulate and calibrate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with agents heterogeneous in demographical characteristics making migration and remittance decision, which is motivated by the altruism to family members. I identify a huge migration cost associated with land, a fixed benefit of living in the urban and an exogenous exit rate out of urban. My decomposition exercise indicates that evolution of household characteristics is determinant for declining remittance over ages. Policy related counterfactual analysis suggests abolishing land associated cost and exogenous exit from urban result in migration rates of  12.87% and 83.31% respectively compared with current rate of 27.51%.
