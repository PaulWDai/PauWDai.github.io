Financial Kuznets Facts (with [Karsten M&uuml;ller](https://www.karstenmueller.com/) and [Emil Verner](https://www.emilverner.com/)) (Draft Available Soon)
  - Abstract: This paper studies the interaction between the sectoral allocation of credit and long-run economic development. The starting point is a new set of Financial Kuznets Facts: as countries get richer, the share of manufacturing credit falls relative to value added, while the opposite is true for credit to the real estate sector. To jointly explain this structural transformation in credit markets and the real economy, we build a two-sector model with heterogeneous collateral constraints in which real estate output supports collateralized borrowing. In a quantitative calibration of our model, differences in sectoral productivity explain most of the structural change in the real economy, while the collateral constraints account more for structural change in credit markets. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these mechanisms and show that the share of manufacturing in outstanding credit is positively correlated with long-run growth. To understand the potential role of government interventions, we show that liberalizations of directed credit policies that channel credit to priority sectors are associated with a redistribution of credit from manufacturing to real estate. Taken together, our analysis suggests that financial frictions play an important role in structural transformation and long-run economic growth by influencing the allocation of credit.

Peer Matters: Peers Matter: Cohort Gender Composition and the Production of Female-Focused Research (with [Hongyunan Xia](https://economics.cornell.edu/hongyuan-xia))

  - Abstract: This paper studies the impact of increasing female representation in doctoral studies on the research direction of PhD students in the same cohort. We measure research direction employing a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a dissertation aims at addressing the needs of women. Leveraging a novel database containing publication record of PhD in the United States, we document that female students exhibit a higher propensity for conducting female-focused research (FFR). Exploiting quasi-random year-to-year fluctuations in the number of female-to-male PhD students ratio at the PhD program level, we find that a greater female cohort share encourages females but discourages males from conducting FFR. Our findings are in favor of a within-gender spillover effect and an across-gender competition effect in research production. Collectively, our results reveal that, besides increasing female PhD participation, within-cohort peer effect is an important factor to resolve the scarcity-substance paradox of FFR production.
