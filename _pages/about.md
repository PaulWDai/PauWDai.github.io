Welcome!

I am an incoming finance PhD student at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), where I previously worked as a Predoc fellow. I obtained my MA in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from Peking University, China, in 2021. Here is my [CV](https://paulwdai.github.io/files/CV_Paul_Dai.pdf).

My research lies at the intersection of finance, macroeconomics, and development. Methodologically, I leverage large-scale granular data, conduct reduced-form analysis with causal identification, and combine it with quantitative models to disentangle potential channels.
