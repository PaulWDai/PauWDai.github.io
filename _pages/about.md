Welcome! I am Paul. I am currently working as a predoc fellow at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Daniel Greenwald](http://www.dlgreenwald.com/) and [Emil Verner](https://www.emilverner.com/).

I obtained my MA in Economics from University of Chicago in June 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from Peking University, China, in July 2021.

My broad research interests are macro-finance, macro-development, family economics and innovation. Methodologically, I am using large-scale granular data, both structured and un-structured, from undigitized historical text data to harmonized cross-country surveys. 

I am applying for PhD this fall.
