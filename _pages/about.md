Welcome! I am Paul. I am currently working as a predoc fellow at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Daniel Greenwald](http://www.dlgreenwald.com/) and [Emil Verner](https://www.emilverner.com/).

I am applying for PhD this cycle (Fall 2024).

I obtained my MA in Economics from University of Chicago in 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from Peking University, China, in 2021.

My broad research interests are macro-finance and macro-development. Methodologically, I leverage large-scale granular data, conduct reduced-form analysis with causal identification, and combine it with quantitative models.
