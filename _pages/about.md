Welcome! I am Paul. I am currently working as a predoc fellow at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Daniel Greenwald](http://www.dlgreenwald.com/) and [Emil Verner](https://www.emilverner.com/). I obtained my MA in Economics from University of Chicago in June 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from Peking University, China, in July 2021. My broad research interests are macro-finance, macro-development, family economics and innovation. My recent research focuses on credit allocation across countries and in the US, the extensive margin of fertility across countries and idea production in the university. Methodologically, I am using large-scale granular data, both structured and un-structured.
